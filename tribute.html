        <h1> <br> Biography</b> <br><br></h1>
        <p>Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA was an English theoretical physicist, <br>
             cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the <br>
              Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge.Hawking's scientific <br>
               works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems <br>
                in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes
                 emit <br> radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set out a theory 
                 of <br> cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum
                  mechanics. <br> His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list 
                  for a  <br> record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime
                   member <br> of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal 
                   of Freedom, <br> the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked
                    number 25 in <br>the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. </p>
